# TODO: Build a Simple HTTP Server

## 1. Understand the Basics of HTTP
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the basic structure of an HTTP request and response.
  - [ ] Request Line (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`)
  - [ ] Headers (e.g., `Host: localhost`)
  - [ ] Body (optional, for methods like POST)

## 2. Set Up Networking (Sockets)
- [ ] Learn socket programming in your chosen language (C, Python, etc.).
- [ ] Create a TCP/IP socket:
  - [ ] Use `socket()` to create a socket.
  - [ ] Use `bind()` to bind the socket to a port and IP address.
  - [ ] Use `listen()` to allow the server to accept incoming connections.

## 3. Accept Incoming Connections
- [ ] Use `accept()` to accept incoming connections from clients (browsers, curl, etc.).
- [ ] Use a new socket for each connection to communicate with the client.

## 4. Read the HTTP Request
- [ ] After accepting a connection, read the HTTP request sent by the client.
- [ ] Parse the request to understand:
  - [ ] HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
  - [ ] Requested resource (e.g., `/index.html`)
  - [ ] Any headers that are sent.

## 5. Generate HTTP Response
- [ ] Create an HTTP response based on the request:
  - [ ] Status Line (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`)
  - [ ] Headers (e.g., `Content-Type: text/html`)
  - [ ] Body (e.g., the content of the file being served).

## 6. Serve Static Content
- [ ] Handle file requests (e.g., `/index.html`).
  - [ ] Open and read the file.
  - [ ] Send the file content as the body of the HTTP response.
  - [ ] Return error response (e.g., `404 Not Found`) if the file doesn't exist.

## 7. Handle Different HTTP Methods
- [ ] Support `GET` requests.
- [ ] Optionally extend to handle `POST` requests:
  - [ ] Handle form submissions or data sent by the client.

## 8. Close the Connection
- [ ] Close the connection after sending the response (or keep it open for persistent connections).
- [ ] For non-persistent connections, close the socket after the response.

## 9. Basic Error Handling
- [ ] Handle common errors:
  - [ ] 404 Not Found (requested resource does not exist).
  - [ ] 500 Internal Server Error (server crashes or unexpected issues).

## 10. Multi-threading or Multiplexing (Optional)
- [ ] Handle multiple clients simultaneously:
  - [ ] Use multi-threading: Spawn a new thread for each connection.
  - [ ] Use non-blocking I/O: Use multiplexing (`select()`) to handle multiple connections.

## 11. Testing
- [ ] Test the server using:
  - [ ] A **browser** (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
  - [ ] Command-line tools like `curl` (e.g., `curl http://localhost:8080`).
- [ ] Verify the server can serve static content and handle different HTTP requests.

## 12. Improvements and Advanced Features
- [ ] Add custom error pages (e.g., `404.html`).
- [ ] Implement SSL/TLS to secure communication (HTTPS).
- [ ] Add logging functionality for incoming requests, errors, etc.
- [ ] Scale the server to handle multiple clients with threads or asynchronous I/O.

---

## Tools/Concepts Needed:
- [ ] Socket API: Understand how sockets work in your chosen language.
- [ ] HTTP Request/Response Format: Learn the client-server communication over HTTP.
- [ ] File I/O: Read and serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, images).
- [ ] Error Handling: Ensure correct HTTP status codes are returned.
